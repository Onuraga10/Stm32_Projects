STM32 Embedded Systems ProjectsThis repository contains my learning journey and driver implementations for various STM32 microcontrollers. The projects range from basic GPIO manipulation to more complex peripheral integrations like ADC, UART, and LCD interfacing.📂 Repository StructureThe projects are organized by microcontroller family and development environment.1. STM32F070 (Value Line)Recent work focused on the F070RB series.Project FolderDescriptionStatus/Dateled_blink_F070Basic GPIO output test (Hello World of embedded).Jan 2026adc_F070Analog-to-Digital Converter implementation for sensor reading.Jan 2026pwm_F070Pulse Width Modulation setup (likely for LED brightness or motor control).Jan 2026uart_F070Serial communication driver implementation.Jan 20262. STM32F107VC / Peripheral ExperimentsDriver development and modular testing.7-segment/: Driver for multiplexing or driving 7-segment displays.LCD_deneme/: LCD interfacing trials (init sequences and character display).USART/: Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter communication.Timers/: Hardware timer configuration for delays or periodic interrupts.PWM/: Signal generation tests.Buzzer/: Passive/Active buzzer control logic.EX33D project/: [Placeholder: Add specific details about this recent project from Jan 2026].3. Simulationproteus_F103c8/: Proteus simulation files for the STM32F103C8 (Blue Pill), used for verifying logic before hardware deployment.🛠 Tools & SoftwareIDE: Keil uVision 5 (MDK-ARM)Hardware:STM32F070RBSTM32F107VCSTM32F103C8 (Simulated)Debugger: ST-Link / J-Link (implied)🚀 Getting StartedTo run these projects:Open the .uvprojx file located in the MDK-ARM or root folder of the specific project (e.g., inside led_blink).Ensure the correct Pack is installed in Keil for the specific chip family (F0 or F1).Build the target (F7) and flash to the board.📝 NotesProjects named with _deneme are experimental trial runs.The STM32F070 folder contains the most recent updates as of early 2026.
